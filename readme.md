# vs-bracematch-outline

## What is it?

You may know ReSharpers option *Highlighting Matching Delimiters, Outline border*. This is some kind of the same functionality. Because I was not able to find this feature somewere else (and maybe free) I thought I could write it myself.

## For what Platform is it?

It works at least for Visual Studio 2017 but it may work on older Versions too.

## What is the current status?

*Early nightly pre alpha*

This extentions works for me but it could be optimized a lot!
